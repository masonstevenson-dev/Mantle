// Is it safe to add a container type (TArray, TMap, etc) to FMantleComponent?
//   -> Currently, I think NO, it would result in a memory leak. Basically what I think happens is when you add an entity
//      to the DB (see FMantleDBChunk::AddEntities), it creates a deep copy of the struct, including any TArray, TMap,
//      etc (see ComponentInstance.GetScriptStruct()->CopyScriptStruct, FArrayProperty::CopyValuesInternal). However,
//      when the entity is destroyed, we currently do not call the destructor on each component struct. So any memory
//      that got allocated during the copy (array data for example), get leaked.
//
//		TODO(): To fix, need to fetch the script struct and call ScriptStruct->DestroyStruct(DataPtr) (see FMassArchetypeData::RemoveEntity for example)
//
// Do mantle components respect GC?
//   -> No. So basically there is no point in using the UPROPERTY() tag on an FMantleComponent, and furthermore it is
//      not safe to store a TObjectPtr<SomeUObject> and expect that object to not get GC'd.
