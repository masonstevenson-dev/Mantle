/**
 * ViewpointTrace Mantle operation. For each entity, performs a line trace from that entity's "viewpoint".
 *
 * Options such as the scan rate can be configured on a per-entity basis using the MC_ViewpointTrace component.
 *
 * This operation outputs temporary perception event entities that can be consumed by downstream systems. These events
 * are produced when the line trace detects an actor in the world with a MantleAvatarComponent, which indicates that the
 * Actor in question represents some entity in the Mantle engine.
 *
 * Input Entity Composition:
 *   + MC_Avatar
 *   + MC_Viewpoint
 *   + MC_ViewpointTrace
 *   
 * Output Entity Composition:
 *   + MC_PerceptionEvent
 *   + MC_ViewpointTraceEvent
 *   + MC_TemporaryEntity
 *   + MC_PlayerPerceptionEvent OR MC_AIPerceptionEvent
